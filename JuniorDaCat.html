<h3>Junior's Origin Story:</h3>

<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">I first found Junior abandoned on campus at York University; he was abandoned at York University on campus and just roaming around covered in dirt. I picked him up by the scruff of his neck and decided to put him in my jacket pocket and take him home. The vet said he was just a regular "SHORT HAIR" domestic cat. </span><br /> <br /><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> ...So that was a lie. He is a giant majestic fluff now.</span></p>
